# TankEA
This program will allow the user to choose different parts of a Evolution Algorith e.g EA such as the Selection, Crossover
and Mutagen of Tank Data.


Below are the parts that need to be implemented:
* GUI, More Selection Schemes, More Crossover Schemes.
* Mutagen Scheme, Code needs to be commented.
* Factory classes for the EA schemes so that it is easier to select one when the GUI is implemented.
  
The program has 4 seperate packages: 
* GUI: This package will hold all the classes linked to the GUI.
* Entities: This package will hold the Tank class and other classes that could be added to the world.
* World: This package holds everything that manage the world such as the object interactions.
* EA: This package holds everything that has anything to do with an Evolution Algorithm such as Selection.
* Crossover and Mutagen schemes which all have there own packages.
